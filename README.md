EpikMovie is a comprehensive movie streaming and download platform that provides users with a seamless experience for both streaming and downloading their favorite movies. As the frontend developer, I took charge of the entire client-side development, ensuring a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality. My responsibilities included:

Frontend API Integration: I handled the integration of APIs, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and backend, and enabling dynamic data display and user interactions.

Logical Implementation: I was responsible for implementing the core logic on the client side, including user authentication, movie search functionality, and responsive design adaptations to enhance user experience across different devices.

Dashboard UI & Data Upload UI: I designed and implemented the dashboard interface, allowing administrators to manage content effortlessly. The data upload interface was also crafted to enable easy movie uploads, with features like drag-and-drop functionality and real-time validation.

Client-Side Logic: I developed the client-side logic to ensure features like video playback, user profiles, watchlists, and download management worked flawlessly, providing an intuitive and responsive experience for users.

Overall, EpikMovie represents a collaborative effort where I focused on delivering a performant, scalable, and visually appealing frontend while working closely with my partner, who managed the backend development.
